     <p>Development and design
        ENIAC's design and construction was financed by the
         United States Army, Ordnance Corps, Research and
         Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon
         M. Barnes. The total cost was about $487,000, 
         equivalent to $6,900,000 in 2023.[14] The conception 
         of ENIAC began in June 1941, when Friden calculators
         and differential analyzers were used by the United
         States Army Ordnance Department to compute firing 
         tables for artillery, which was done by graduate 
         students under John Mauchly's supervision. Mauchly
         began to wonder if electronics could be applied to
         mathematics for faster calculations. He partnered 
         up with research associate J. Presper Eckert, as
         Mauchly wasn't an electronics expert, to draft 
         an electronic computer that could work at an 
         excellent pace. Later, in August 1942, Mauchly
         proposed an all-electronic calculating machine
         that could help the U.S. Army calculate complex
         ballistics tables.[15][16] The U.S. Army 
         Ordnance accepted their plan, giving the 
         University of Pennsylvania a six-months 
         research contract for $61,700.[17] The
         construction contract was signed on June 5,
         1943; work on the computer began in secret 
         at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore 
         School of Electrical Engineering[18] the 
         following month, under the code name "Project
         PX", with John Grist Brainerd as principal
         investigator. Herman H. Goldstine persuaded 
         the Army to fund the project, which put him 
         in charge to oversee it for them.[19] 
         Assembly for the computer began in June 1944.
         [17] Later, in September of that year,
         Eckert and Mauchly completed their 
         conception on the computer.[20] Construction 
         for the computer was complete in May 1945,
         and testing for it began at the Moore
         School. Later, in November of that year, 
         the duo, along with John Brainerd and
         Herman Goldstine, issued the first                 
         confidential published report on the 
         computer, which talks about how it worked 
         and the methods by which it was programmed.[16]</p>
